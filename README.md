##MockMovement 
MockMovment is a "Symbolic Protest" against the "stakeholders" of Nepal's Constitutional Assembly, who were unable to give Nepal a constitution and it does not seem likely that WE will get the Constitution in near future.

We WILL NOT look up to "get" the Constitution, it is to be MADE, therefore we are starting this initiative to show, how the Constitution can/should be written Openly and Collaboratively.

The skeleton has been derived from the current Interim Constitution of Nepal, which can be found <a href="www.worldstatesmen.org/Nepal_Interim_Constitution2007.pdf">Here</a>. We would like everybody to contibute to the cause.

##Disclaimer: This is NOT intended, by any mean, to offend Nepal or THE INTERIM CONSTITUTION OF NEPAL, 2063 (2007).
